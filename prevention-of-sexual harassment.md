# What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

#### Stay safe
Prioritize your safety and the safety of others involved. If the situation feels dangerous, remove yourself and others from harm's way if possible.

#### Report the incident
If you are a witness, encourage the victim to report the incident to their immediate supervisor, human resources department, or any designated authority within the organization. If you are the victim, report it yourself. Many workplaces have policies in place to address sexual harassment, and reporting it is essential for addressing the issue.

#### Document details
If you are a witness or victim, document the incident(s) with as much detail as possible. Note the date, time, location, the individuals involved, and what exactly occurred. This information can be valuable when reporting the incident.

#### Seek support
Encourage the victim to seek support from friends, family, or counselors. If you are the victim, don't hesitate to reach out to someone you trust for support and understanding.

#### Follow the established procedures
If your workplace or institution has a protocol for handling sexual harassment complaints, ensure that you follow it. This may involve speaking with a designated person or providing a written complaint.

#### Encourage others to come forward
Let others know that you take sexual harassment seriously and that you will support them if they choose to report incidents.

#### Respect confidentiality
If the victim requests confidentiality, respect their wishes. Confidentiality can be critical for their well-being, but it's also important to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to address the issue.

#### If necessary, involve authorities
In severe cases or if the harassment occurs outside of a workplace or educational setting, consider involving law enforcement.
