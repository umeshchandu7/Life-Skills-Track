## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
 According to Fisher's model, the key points of reflective listening are:

* Pay attention to the speaker's words, body language, and tone of voice. This will help you to understand the full meaning of what they are saying.
* Reflect back what the speaker has said, using their own words. This shows that you have been listening and that you understand their point of view.
* Ask clarifying questions if you are not sure what the speaker means. This will help you to get a better understanding of their perspective.
* Avoid judging the speaker or their thoughts. This will help you to create a safe space for the speaker to share their thoughts and feelings.
* Be patient and understanding. Reflective listening takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged if you don't get it right away.

In simple English, reflective listening is about listening to what the speaker is saying, understanding their point of view, and reflecting that back to them. It is a way of showing that you are listening and that you care about what they have to say.

Here are some examples of reflective listening:

* *"So, you're feeling frustrated because you're not sure how to complete the project."*
* *"You seem to be feeling angry because you feel like you're not being heard."*
* *"It sounds like you're feeling sad because your friend moved away."*
## 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?

Some of the obstacles that I face in my listening process include:

* Prejudice or prejudging: I may have preconceived notions about the speaker or the topic, which can make it difficult for me to listen objectively.
* Information overload: If the speaker is giving me too much information at once, it can be difficult for me to process everything and to keep track of what is being said.
* Rate of speech and thought: If the speaker is speaking too quickly or if their thoughts are moving too quickly for me to follow, it can be difficult for me to listen effectively.
* Internal and external distractions. If I am feeling distracted by my own thoughts or by external factors, such as noise or other people, it can be difficult for me to focus on what the speaker is saying.

I am working on overcoming these obstacles by learning more about active listening and reflective listening. I am also practicing listening to different types of people and in different settings. I believe that with time and practice, I will be able to become a better listener.

Here are some additional obstacles that humans may face in their listening process:

* Emotional barriers. If the speaker is talking about a topic that is emotionally charged, it can be difficult for the listener to stay objective and to listen effectively.
* Cultural barriers: If the speaker and the listener have different cultural backgrounds, it can be difficult for them to understand each other's communication styles.
* Physical barriers: If the speaker and the listener are in a noisy environment or if there is a language barrier, it can be difficult for them to communicate effectively.

## 5. When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

I switch to passive communication when I am feeling afraid, intimidated, or uncomfortable.

I might also be more likely to say "yes" when I mean "no," or to avoid expressing my opinions.

I switch to aggressive communication when I am feeling angry or frustrated. For example, if I am playing a game of basketball and I am not doing well, I might start yelling at my teammates or the other team. I might also be more likely to make personal attacks or to put people down.

I switch to passive aggressive communication when I am feeling resentful or passive-aggressive. For example, if I am feeling resentful towards my partner, I might start making sarcastic remarks or gossiping about them to my friends. I might also start giving them the silent treatment or doing things to annoy them.

I can make my communication assertive by following these steps:
